# Gemini Delegation Rules

## When to Delegate

Consider delegating the following tasks to Gemini:

1. **Large-scale research**: Multi-source information gathering
2. **Technology comparison**: Framework/library comparative analysis
3. **Trend analysis**: Latest technology trends research
4. **Codebase analysis**: Holistic understanding of large repositories

## Delegation Process

1. Clarify the research purpose and expected output
2. Use the template in `.gemini/GEMINI.md`
3. Ask to save results in `.claude/docs/research/`
4. Claude reads results and uses them for decision-making

## When NOT to Delegate

- When immediate answers are needed
- When project-specific context is required
- When dealing with security-sensitive information

## Cost Considerations

- Gemini: Free (within API limits)
- Large context window (1M tokens)
- Ideal for analyzing long documents
