## Key Competitor Issues

- **Devin**: 15% task success rate, $500/mo team plan, gets stuck in loops
- **Cursor**: Pricing backlash (credit-based), $10-20/day overages reported, security CVEs
- **Windsurf**: Acquired by Cognition (Devin) Dec 2025, future uncertain
- **Bolt/v0**: Limited to greenfield web apps, breaks at scale
- **Replit**: Browser-only, platform lock-in, unpredictable effort-based pricing

## aiki Unique Differentiators

1. **Multi-AI Collaboration** (only tool doing this)
2. **Radical Cost Efficiency** (~$0.21/feature vs $500/mo)
3. **Open Source** (no lock-in)
4. **Full Development Lifecycle** (research→design→implement→test→review→deploy)
5. **Human-in-the-Loop** (addresses the "almost right" problem)
