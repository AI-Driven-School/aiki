echo "**Real-time research task detected**
   Grok (xAI) excels at real-time X search and trend analysis.

   To delegate to Grok:
   1. Use the request template in .grok/GROK.md
   2. Ask to save results in .claude/docs/research/

   To continue with Claude: No action needed (Claude will search directly)"
